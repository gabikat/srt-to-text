931
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,839
well such as china for instance um

932
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,839



933
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,560
us kind of favored the

934
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:18,560



935
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,240
chiang kai-shek in china and they didn't

936
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,240



937
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,519
overly like the communist regime but

938
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,519



939
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
they didn't directly help them for

940
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:22,639



941
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,360
various reasons

942
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:25,360



943
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,720
on the other hand the ussr had favored

944
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,720



945
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,079
uh the communist

946
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,079



947
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,839
leader mal and supplied them with a lot

948
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:31,839



949
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,160
of help and eventually

950
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:34,160



951
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,000
they took over mainland china other

952
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,000



953
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,720
cases where we had that proxy so i was a

954
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,720



955
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,079
fairly

956
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,079



957
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,160
large proxy battle although they didn't

958
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:42,160



959
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,839
help much on this end

960
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,839



961
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
another one where there's direct more

962
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:45,519



963
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
direct involvement

964
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,600



965
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,440
cases in southeast asia vietnam for

966
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,440



967
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
instance proxy battles

968
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,839



969
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,680
countries in central america where

970
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,680



971
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,519
directly or indirectly each side is

972
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,519



973
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,440
helping out their favored

974
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:59,440



975
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,920
regime the cold war the hostilities can

976
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,920



977
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,880
exist in other forms although the cold

978
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,880



979
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,439
war

980
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,439



981
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
doesn't quite exist doesn't exist or

982
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:06,880



983
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,480
doesn't quite exist at least in the

984
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,480



985
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,079
format that exists today

986
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,079



987
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,079
there's still the legacy of it at the

988
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,079



989
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,360
very least or some historians might say

990
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,360



991
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,839
it's gone on into

992
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,839



993
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,839
a different form because the warsaw pact

994
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,839



995
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
no longer exists the ussr no longer

996
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,319



997
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,160
exists

998
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,160



999
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,160
we have the russian federation but the

1000
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,160



1001
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,559
russian federation isn't so friendly

1002
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,559



1003
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,120
with

1004
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:25,120



1005
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,839
the uh current nato allies and there's a

1006
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,839



1007
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,839
cold war

1008
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,839



1009
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,440
where there's espionage between the two

1010
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,440



1011
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,200
for instance and

1012
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,200



1013
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,039
in terms of attacks well there's the

1014
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,039



1015
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
electronic attacks for instance

1016
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,480



1017
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
other attacks they refer to as the

1018
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,080



1019
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,240
asymmetric warfare

1020
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,240



1021
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,000
asymmetric because now the russian

1022
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,000



1023
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,400
federation by itself

1024
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,400



1025
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,160
is by itself isn't nearly as powerful as

1026
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,160



1027
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,520
the ussr it's lost a lot of

1028
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,520



1029
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,039
it's uh it's it's it's um

1030
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,039



1031
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,919
it's states such as the uh uh kazakhstan

1032
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,919



1033
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:56,160
ukraine and so on other places so the

1034
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:56,160



1035
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,280
ussr itself has been broken up but it's

1036
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,280



1037
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,600
lost essentially

1038
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,600



1039
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,120
it's it's satellite states such as the

1040
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,120



1041
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,559
east germany

1042
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,559



1043
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,520
czechoslovakia and all the other

1044
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,520



1045
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,440
countries used to be communist countries

1046
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,440



1047
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,360
so they can't directly take on nato so

1048
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,360



1049
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,320
they call asymmetric warfare where the

1050
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,320



1051
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,600
ussr

1052
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,600



1053
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,720
has been accused of meddling essentially

1054
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,720



1055
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,679
in affairs in the west

1056
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,679



1057
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,280
such as the aforementioned uh that i

1058
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,280



1059
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,960
talked about the previous section notes

1060
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,960



1061
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:27,039
american um elections

1062
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,039



1063
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,039
so this is the cold war that started

1064
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:29,039



1065
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,559
at the least 1950s although one might

1066
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:30,559



1067
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,880
say even before that some

1068
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,880



1069
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,000
some and whether or not it's continued

1070
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,000



1071
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,919
directly continued

1072
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,919



1073
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
or indirectly it still exists in some

1074
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,280



1075
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,160
form

1076
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,160



1077
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,160
this cold war

1078
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,390



1079
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,720
you can see the cold war had its origins

1080
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,720



1081
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,400
obviously in world war

1082
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,400



1083
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,440
ii former allies um split into two camps

1084
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,440



1085
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,120
and the countries that they each

1086
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,120



1087
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,240
involved that were involved on this side

1088
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,240



1089
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,039
the countries that were taken over on

1090
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,039



1091
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,480
this side

1092
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:58,480



1093
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,480
became part of two different alliances

1094
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,480



1095
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,400
now with this cold war it does have a

1096
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,400



1097
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,240
direct effect on the internet so world

1098
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,240



1099
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,320
war ii had a indirect

1100
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,320



1101
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,840
effect on the cold war cold wars we'll

1102
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,840



1103
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,840
see has had a direct effect on the

1104
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,840



1105
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
internet

1106
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:14,710



1107
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
the cold war one way that the two sides

1108
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,640



1109
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,640
were

1110
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,640



1111
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,640
competing was the space race

1112
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,710



1113
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,080
now what we're talking about is before

1114
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,080



1115
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
humans were able to send

1116
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,240



1117
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,200
artificial satellites into space they

1118
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,200



1119
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,840
were both

1120
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,840



1121
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,799
competing on the ground to be dominant

1122
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,799



1123
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
in different ways

1124
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,640



1125
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,000
with standard weapons conventional

1126
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,000



1127
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,679
weapons as they referred to

1128
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,679



1129
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,320
non-nuclear type weapons um but also

1130
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:42,320



1131
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
um when when nuclear weapons became more

1132
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,600



1133
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,160
common for each

1134
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,160



1135
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,280
uh major power they were competing and

1136
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,280



1137
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,679
still competing

1138
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,679



1139
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,120
in terms of uh their nuclear weaponry

1140
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:51,120



1141
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,720
but in addition to that

1142
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,720



1143
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,960
they're also trying to be dominant in

1144
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,960



1145
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,440
the space now there's a few reasons

1146
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,440



1147
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,440
why they were trying to be dominant

1148
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,430



1149
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,520
partly it was the bragging rights the

1150
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,520



1151
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,000
first country i could send an artificial

1152
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,000



1153
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,080
satellite

1154
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,080



1155
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
into space there's a great propaganda

1156
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,600



1157
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,280
effect we

1158
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,280



1159
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,200
you don't believe in the propaganda

1160
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,200



1161
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,880
effect well look at the

1162
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,880



1163
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,880
um what they call the sputnik

1164
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,950



1165
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
i'm talking about the vaccine the split

1166
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,840



1167
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,400
neck i think they called sputnik 2.

1168
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,400



1169
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,960
the russian federation said quote they

1170
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,960



1171
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,360
came up with the first vaccine cure

1172
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,360



1173
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,960
treatment for covid of course the only

1174
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,960



1175
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,080
test on a few dozen people whereas

1176
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,080



1177
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,159
normally you test on

1178
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,159



1179
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,440
tens of thousands one of the reasons why

1180
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,440



1181
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,600
they pushed for that

1182
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,600



1183
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,559
is for the bragging rights we are the

1184
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,559



1185
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,320
first country

1186
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,320



1187
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,840
that came up with it that's what what

1188
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,840



1189
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,960
they say and that's the story to stick

1190
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,960



1191
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,520
to it

1192
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,520



1193
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,880
but obviously no one's uh no other

1194
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,880



1195
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,960
countries have

1196
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,960



1197
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,200
wide skill adopted it because they only

1198
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,200



1199
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
tested on a few dozen people for gossip

1200
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,720



1201
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,720
when you should be testing

1202
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,720



1203
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
with well the americans need 30 000

1204
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,000



1205
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,000
people for it to be

1206
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,000



1207
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,240
at minimum to be to be approved by their

1208
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,240



1209
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,200
fda so there's bragging rights of that

1210
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,200



1211
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,880
don't underestimate that there's still

1212
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,880



1213
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
some breaking rights talking about terms

1214
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,200



1215
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
of

1216
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,880



1217
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,559
technological advances covet

1218
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,559



1219
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,320
bragging and other benefits who's

1220
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,320



1221
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,000
getting the covet vaccine first

1222
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,000



1223
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,960
there's obviously other advantages for

1224
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,960



1225
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,880
that but sending the satellite in the

1226
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,880



1227
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
space besides just the propaganda and

1228
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,320



1229
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,039
bragging rights the morale

1230
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:23,039



1231
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,360
the perceived morale advantages if one

1232
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,360



1233
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,960
can

1234
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,960



1235
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,480
actually develop a mechanism for

1236
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,480



1237
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,880
launching a satellite in space to

1238
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:30,880



1239
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,320
basically break earth's gravity

1240
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,320



1241
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,000
then that is a major strategic advantage

1242
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,000



1243
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,600
because you have technology lance

1244
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,600



1245
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,720
launched something in orbit

1246
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,720



1247
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,320
now potentially it's um

1248
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,320



1249
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,640
it's possible to be able to launch

1250
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,640



1251
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,760
something say from us

1252
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,760



1253
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,960
ussr longer range missiles

1254
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,960



1255
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,120
so it also has military applications

1256
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,120



1257
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
and the direct i think i've definitely

1258
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,480



1259
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,840
mentioned this a little bit

1260
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,840



1261
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,000
the direct analogy is korea

1262
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,000



1263
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,679
north korea was another one of the proxy

1264
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,679



1265
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,120
fights between

1266
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:05,120



1267
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,559
um the korean conflict between the

1268
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,559



1269
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,480
warsaw pact and the

1270
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:12,480



1271
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,960
and nato but modern day north korea

1272
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,960



1273
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,799
they're frequently doing various things

1274
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,799



1275
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,720
depending on who you ask

1276
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:18,720



1277
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,799
trying to launch missiles or they just

1278
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,799



1279
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
say artificial satellites but even if

1280
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:21,360



1281
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,760
they're

1282
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,760



1283
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,440
truly just researching the ability to

1284
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,440



1285
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,679
launch artificial

1286
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,679



1287
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
probes into space if they have that

1288
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,360



1289
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,000
ability to launch artificial probes into

1290
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,000



1291
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,000
space

1292
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,000



1293
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,120
then that improves their ability to

1294
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,120



1295
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,679
launch missiles

1296
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,679



1297
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,799
that can i believe they can reach the

1298
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:36,799



1299
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
hawaiian islands

1300
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,960



1301
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,000
the u.s part of the u.s and possibly

1302
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,000



1303
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
alaska but

1304
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,520



1305
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,919
also reach different parts of

1306
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,919



1307
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,960
continental us and that's why it's so

1308
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:46,960



1309
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,520
um somewhat of so much concern to the

1310
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,520



1311
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,559
u.s

1312
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,559



1313
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,919
that a state like north korea is either

1314
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:51,919



1315
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,799
working under quote

1316
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:54,799



1317
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,880
satellite launching capability or

1318
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:56,880



1319
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,520
essentially the rocket program and other

1320
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,520



1321
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
states

1322
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,440



1323
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,799
in the middle east are of

1324
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,799



1325
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,960
have been of um of um

1326
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,960



1327
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,000
interest so we say to countries such as

1328
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,000



1329
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,640
the u.s for different

1330
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,640



1331
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,440
reasons but for similar essentially that

1332
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,440



1333
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,480
developing that technology

1334
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,480



1335
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,120
so in the 1950s

1336
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,120



1337
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,360
it appeared that the ussr now this isn't

1338
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,360



1339
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,600
a quote technological ad but a real one

1340
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,600



1341
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,600
they had the technological edge what was

1342
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,600



1343
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,840
happening was in 1957 the americans

1344
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,840



1345
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,280
the americans if you look at their mail

1346
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,280



1347
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,440
you've heard probably many things about

1348
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,440



1349
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,240
their military spending budget

1350
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,240



1351
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,080
um one metric they use is the number of

1352
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,080



1353
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,799
aircraft carriers the the ships that can

1354
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,799



1355
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,640
carry air

1356
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,640



1357
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,640
uh full fleet carriers that can carry

1358
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,640



1359
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,840
airplanes jets bombers

1360
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,840



1361
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,400
uh dead bombish type type planes

1362
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,400



1363
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,440
um they have a fleet of 20 of these last

1364
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,440



1365
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,880
i checked

1366
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,880



1367
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,440
um china just got one a secondhand one

1368
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,440



1369
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,000
that was a cast off from the old ussr

1370
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,000



1371
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,559
um the ussr i'm not too sure how many uh

1372
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,559



1373
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
sorry the

1374
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:02,400



1375
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,039
russian federation how many they have

1376
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,039



1377
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,760
but they don't have that 20. and canada

1378
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:07,760



1379
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,840
fleet carriers has zero so they they

1380
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,840



1381
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,400
this is one reason why they spend

1382
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,400



1383
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,840
uh their military budget so much another

1384
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,840



1385
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,480
reason is

1386
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,480



1387
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,039
to use a programming metaphor they if i

1388
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,039



1389
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,679
described how they spent on their weapon

1390
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,679



1391
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,840
tree

1392
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,840



1393
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,360
using a metaphor programming metaphor

1394
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,360



1395
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,320
well

1396
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:28,320



1397
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,760
they would be writing a program that had

1398
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,760



1399
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,080
all the bells and whistles

1400
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,080



1401
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,440
handled all the cases or almost all the

1402
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,440



1403
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,240
cases that you can imagine

1404
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,240



1405
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,440
had fancy features for robustness and so

1406
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,440



1407
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,919
on

1408
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,919



1409
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
their artificial satellite 1950s a

1410
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:40,960



1411
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,120
sophisticated one

1412
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,120



1413
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
bells and whistles three stage rockets

1414
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,960



1415
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,440
so you'd launch off the one stage

1416
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,440



1417
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,799
enough of a a rocket to launch you so

1418
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,799



1419
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,559
the initial part would

1420
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,559



1421
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,120
fall off we didn't need any more because

1422
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:53,120



1423
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,840
we were uh we were up high enough we

1424
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,840



1425
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,440
had uh earth's gravity was loaded up so

1426
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,440



1427
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,039
we had a second stage and so on that's

1428
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,039



1429
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,279
what pages rockets very simply put

1430
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:03,279



1431
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,960
and they had planned it as the first

1432
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,960



1433
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,400
artificial satellite

1434
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:08,400



1435
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,279
to be sent into space however the ussr

1436
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,279



1437
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,279
beat them to the punch

1438
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,510



1439
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,760
they essentially their metaphor to

1440
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,760



1441
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,880
extend the metaphor of programming they

1442
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,880



1443
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,159
the u.s planned a very fancy program a

1444
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,159



1445
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
very fancy

1446
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:22,880



1447
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,559
uh they included very fancy technology

1448
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,559



1449
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,640
in the rocket

1450
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,640



1451
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,240
what'd the soviets do ah essentially

1452
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,240



1453
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,840
and they really surprised the whole

1454
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,840



1455
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,520
world basically with their hack they

1456
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,520



1457
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,919
launched sputnik one

1458
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,919



1459
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,840
the the latest footnick i think it's to

1460
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,840



1461
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,480
anyhow the i know it's sputnik something

1462
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,480



1463
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,039
the

1464
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,039



1465
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,559
so-called vaccine for kovid that was

1466
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:42,559



1467
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,360
supposed to be developed by the

1468
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:45,360



1469
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,120
and you can hear my and other peoples

1470
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,120



1471
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,840
people who are experts in the field

1472
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,840



1473
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,200
have some skepticism about the the the

1474
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,200



1475
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,520
efficacy of it

1476
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,520



1477
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,880
um but not the efficacy of the the

1478
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,880



1479
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,760
sputnik one

1480
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,760



1481
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
efficacy of the vaccine split neck one

1482
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,480



1483
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,320
basically

1484
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,320



1485
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,960
it was just an adaptation of their

1486
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,960



1487
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,720
military rockets

1488
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,720



1489
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,200
and it was the first artificial

1490
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,200



1491
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,760
satellite and we see the sputnik

1492
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,760



1493
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,600
here in a picture so it's brought into

1494
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,600



1495
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,320
orbit

1496
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,320



1497
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,960
using adaptation of their military

1498
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,960



1499
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
technology

1500
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,310



1501
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,279
well let's put this in perspective

1502
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,279



1503
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,159
now besides having this cold war at the

1504
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:28,159



1505
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,880
time

1506
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,880



1507
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,840
nuclear weapons were new in 1945 they

1508
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,840



1509
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,200
were first

1510
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,200



1511
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,360
and the only time that they're used

1512
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,360



1513
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,799
against nation state was against japan

1514
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,799



1515
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,960
and hiroshima and nagasaki

1516
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:40,960



1517
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,440
new and very scary weapon and there's

1518
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,440



1519
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,559
still a scary weapon although not so new

1520
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,559



1521
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,039
in the 1950s if you look at old history

1522
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:47,039



1523
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,200
books

1524
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:49,200



1525
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,840
history documentaries there was very

1526
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,840



1527
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,840
much a fear

1528
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,840



1529
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
of

1530
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:53,990



1531
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,840
the possibility of nuclear war nuclear

1532
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,840



1533
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,880
annihilation

1534
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,880



1535
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,279
um they used to refer to it as mad

1536
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,279



1537
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,559
mutually-ish i believe was mad mutually

1538
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:04,559



1539
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,320
assured destruction

1540
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,320



1541
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,480
where both sides would wipe each other

1542
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,480



1543
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,640
out if a nuclear war occurred

1544
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,640



1545
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,000
so both sides were quite scared

1546
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,000



1547
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,600
consequently with this

1548
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,600



1549
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,520
background information the u.s

1550
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,520



1551
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,240
did not take this well it wasn't

1552
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,240



1553
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,399
it wasn't similar to the reception when

1554
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,399



1555
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,880
the russian federation said that we have

1556
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,880



1557
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,640
a cure for covet they just

1558
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,640



1559
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,480
they didn't react much most countries

1560
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,480



1561
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,320
didn't react much they tried to analyze

1562
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,320



1563
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,000
what information was available for the

1564
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,000



1565
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,880
the um vaccine coveted but the satellite

1566
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,880



1567
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,799
culvert

1568
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,799



1569
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,159
basically caused the americans to freak

1570
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:40,159



1571
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
right out

1572
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,240



1573
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,200
because for the reasons i described well

1574
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,200



1575
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,279
there's the

1576
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,279



1577
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,279
the the morale boost there's the

1578
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,279



1579
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,159
propaganda bragging rights but also

1580
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,159



1581
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,799
militarily

1582
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:50,799



1583
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,520
if the ussr could launch an artificial

1584
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:51,520



1585
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,679
satellite

1586
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,679



1587
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,640
now they've got believed in advance

1588
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:54,640



1589
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,600
quite rightfully

1590
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,600



1591
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,480
that they have advanced their missile

1592
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,480



1593
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,679
technology

1594
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,679



1595
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:07,440
to better attack the us and its allies

1596
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:07,440



1597
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,919
so in response the u.s created

1598
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,919



1599
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,120
arpa the arpa project which is yet

1600
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:11,120



1601
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,440
another acronym

1602
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,440



1603
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,320
the advanced research projects agency in

1604
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,320



1605
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,240
the u.s

1606
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,240



1607
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,240
and this agency still exists today uh

1608
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,240



1609
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,679
it's undergone number of name changes

1610
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,679



1611
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,640
you look under arpa i believe that's

1612
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:24,640



1613
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,880
back to darpa again arpa darpa and then

1614
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,880



1615
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,720
uh you can look it up i've lost track of

1616
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,720



1617
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,320
the number of name changes

1618
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:30,320



1619
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
it still exists and you can actually see

1620
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,000



1621
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,679
the research that they do they're not

1622
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,679



1623
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,320
just involved in research for military

1624
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:34,320



1625
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
research

1626
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,440



1627
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,440
but actually saw uh under the current

1628
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,440



1629
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,640
uh current project name they actually

1630
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,640



1631
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
are conducting research

1632
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,320



1633
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,960
they have early on in the spring they're

1634
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,960



1635
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,399
conducting research for a cohort vaccine

1636
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:48,399



1637
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,760
they do some good work um so but the

1638
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:51,760



1639
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,840
motivations for our book came from

1640
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,840



1641
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,120
the launch of the sputnik which came

1642
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,120



1643
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,440
from

1644
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,440



1645
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,960
the cold war which came which was

1646
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,960



1647
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,600
indirectly affected by

1648
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,600



1649
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,279
world war ii but we still haven't gotten

1650
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,279



1651
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,080
to the internet yet the internet's

1652
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:04,080



1653
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,120
coming up

1654
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,120



1655
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,039
we're building to the climax here

1656
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,039



1657
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,640
just to add insult to entry to make the

1658
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,640



1659
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,080
us feel like well no they're actually

1660
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,080



1661
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,840
trying to advance their search

1662
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,840



1663
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,159
legitimately later at night so the early

1664
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,159



1665
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,679
1950s earlier in 1957

1666
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:19,679



1667
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,360
the ussr launched sputnik later in 1957

1668
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:21,360



1669
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,000
they launched yet another artificial

1670
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,000



1671
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,880
life

1672
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,880



1673
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,640
an artificial satellite that could carry

1674
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,640



1675
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
a life form up in it

1676
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,720



1677
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
and that's different because sputnik

1678
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,480



1679
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,840
didn't actually have any life forms it

1680
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,840



1681
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
didn't have to have a life support

1682
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,480



1683
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,559
system

1684
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,559



1685
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,399
now they developed a second satellite

1686
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:36,399



1687
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,880
that could have an artificial

1688
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:38,880



1689
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,559
uh that had a life support system that

1690
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,559



1691
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
launched a dog leica

1692
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:42,960



1693
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,240
which is supposed to be russian forgive

1694
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,240



1695
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
me if i'm pronouncing that i'm

1696
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,679



1697
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,080
undoubtedly pronouncing this wrong for

1698
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,080



1699
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,640
russian speaking people as best i can

1700
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,640



1701
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,760
leica uh which referred to barker barker

1702
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,760



1703
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
and russian

1704
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,360



1705
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,720
therefore to you poor poor little guy

1706
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,720



1707
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,000
it's a one-way trip to space

1708
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,000



1709
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:04,159
yeah and that's not a sarcastic sigh i

1710
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:04,159



1711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,120
yeah double checking my technology as

1712
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,120



1713
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,640
far as i see

1714
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,640



1715
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,919
i just took a quick look at my recording

1716
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,919



1717
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,240
one that's why there's a bit of a break

1718
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:08,240



1719
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,080
there

1720
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,080



1721
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,520
to see if it's still appears recording

1722
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,520



1723
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,919
thank gosh

1724
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,919



1725
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,919
okay

1726
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,710



1727
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,000
before this the us had the image

1728
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:18,000



1729
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,919
basically as being

1730
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,919



1731
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,279
the numeral uno and that wasn't just

1732
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:21,279



1733
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,440
propaganda

1734
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:23,440



1735
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,120
they were the first ones that actually

1736
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,120



1737
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,159
successfully

1738
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,159



1739
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,360
developed and actually

1740
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:31,360



1741
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,679
used nuclear weaponry

1742
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,679



1743
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,279
and that's a scary thing good thing or

1744
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:35,279



1745
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,360
not

1746
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,360



1747
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,120
well good u.s thought it was a good

1748
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,120



1749
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,880
thing in terms of their

1750
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,880



1751
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,880
their defense obviously not so good for

1752
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,880



1753
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,080
the country where it was dropped on them

1754
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,080



1755
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,200
but this really cemented the image of us

1756
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,200



1757
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,679
being dominant

1758
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,679



1759
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,720
and in terms of conventional forces they

1760
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:50,720



1761
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,840
were

1762
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,840



1763
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,279
extremely powerful if you interested you

1764
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,279



1765
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,679
could actually look at the comparisons

1766
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:57,679



1767
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,399
of the u.s weapons at the end of world

1768
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:58,399



1769
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,919
war ii

1770
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,919



1771
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:04,240
their fighter craft their warships

1772
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:04,240



1773
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,000
and you compare their theirs versus

1774
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,000



1775
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,559
their tanks versus soviet

1776
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,559



1777
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,399
and typically they come out ahead um in

1778
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,399



1779
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,360
terms of one-on-one but the total

1780
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:11,360



1781
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,600
numbers

1782
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,600



1783
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,000
uh so that the the soviet union could do

1784
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,000



1785
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,720
this

1786
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,720



1787
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,720
it really shook um that image

1788
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,870



1789
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,960
and as i've said if they could lance

1790
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,960



1791
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,399
launch these artificial satellites and

1792
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,399



1793
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,039
space as i said many times

1794
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,039



1795
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,080
then that improves their ability to hit

1796
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,080



1797
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,080
continental u.s

1798
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,310



1799
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,919
so as a solution quote solution

1800
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:41,919



1801
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,840
it was believed the solution was well

1802
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:43,840



1803
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,480
let's throw more money in math and

1804
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,480



1805
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,720
science

1806
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,720



1807
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,080
and we saw with the uh was it the von

1808
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,080



1809
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,519
neumann interview if you actually saw

1810
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,519



1811
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,799
the extra little one

1812
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:52,799



1813
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,279
the it was believed that in grade school

1814
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:55,279



1815
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,000
that they needed more math and science

1816
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:56,000



1817
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,640
uh

1818
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,640



1819
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,080
especially high school so that americans

1820
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,080



1821
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,080
coming out of grade school

1822
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,080



1823
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,279
because not so many americans then not

1824
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,279



1825
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,080
so many people in the world

1826
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:06,080



1827
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,200
actually got a post-secondary education

1828
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,200



1829
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,559
could

1830
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,559



1831
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,880
produce better work out think their

1832
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:10,880



1833
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,120
soviet counterparts and then some of the

1834
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,120



1835
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,120
interesting things i dug up

1836
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,120



1837
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,679
trying to find specific now we've heard

1838
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,679



1839
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,240
out of that if you've watched your

1840
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,240



1841
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,039
news reels or propaganda reels actual

1842
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,039



1843
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
newsreels

1844
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:23,200



1845
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
on that era they frequently say do this

1846
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,399



1847
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,679
and they'd say do

1848
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:27,679



1849
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,279
x action do it for your country buy

1850
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:29,279



1851
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,600
bonds do it for your country

1852
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,600



1853
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,120
it's patriotic and they still do that

1854
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,120



1855
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,399
sort of thing these days

1856
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,399



1857
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,799
um for a while the

1858
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:38,799



1859
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,720
the current american president said i

1860
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:40,720



1861
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,279
believe he said i know the

1862
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,279



1863
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,519
incoming president said um wear a mask

1864
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:45,519



1865
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,799
it's it's it's your your american duty

1866
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:46,799



1867
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,640
something that effect

1868
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:48,640



1869
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,720
now fine now this is the first time i've

1870
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,720



1871
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,960
heard someone say apparently

1872
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,960



1873
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,720
this very pitch for your own sake but

1874
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,720



1875
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,799
for patriotism

1876
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,799



1877
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,399
do your homework apparently that was a

1878
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:58,399



1879
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,360
quote from the harvard university

1880
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:01,360



1881
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,360
president at the time james bryant

1882
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,360



1883
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,880
so it was believed to be studying was

1884
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,880



1885
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,720
patriotic

1886
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,720



1887
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,240
now whether or not it succeeded getting

1888
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,240



1889
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,480
kids to

1890
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,480



1891
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,039
do their math homework well that that's

1892
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,039



1893
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,039
another thing

1894
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,509



1895
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,080
dwight eisenhower white oops white

1896
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,080



1897
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,320
eisenhower i talked about

1898
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,320



1899
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,679
in terms of we call the american

1900
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,679



1901
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,480
election eisenhower

1902
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:24,480



1903
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,000
versus uh stevenson he was a famous

1904
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,000



1905
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,399
american general and as you know he

1906
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,399



1907
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,399
became

1908
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,789
