	well such as china for instance .. 

	us kind of favored the chiang kai-shek in china and they didn't overly like the communist regime but they didn't directly help them for various reasons on the other hand the ussr had favored .. the communist 

	leader mal and supplied them with a lot of help and eventually they took over mainland china other cases where we had that proxy so i was a fairly 

	large proxy battle although they didn't help much on this end another one where there's direct more direct involvement cases in southeast asia vietnam for instance proxy battles countries in central america where directly or indirectly each side is helping out their favored 

	regime the cold war the hostilities can exist in other forms although the cold war doesn't quite exist doesn't exist or doesn't quite exist at least in the format that exists today there's still the legacy of it at the very least or some historians might say it's gone on into a different form because the warsaw pact no longer exists the ussr no longer exists we have the russian federation but the russian federation isn't so friendly with the .. current nato allies and there's a cold war where there's espionage between the two for instance and in terms of attacks well there's the electronic attacks for instance other attacks they refer to as the asymmetric warfare asymmetric because now the russian federation by itself is by itself isn't nearly as powerful as the ussr it's lost a lot of 

	it's .. it's it's it's .. 


00:17:47,520
	

	it's states such as the .. .. kazakhstan ukraine and so on other places so the ussr itself has been broken up but it's lost essentially it's it's satellite states such as the east germany czechoslovakia and all the other countries used to be communist countries so they can't directly take on nato so they call asymmetric warfare where the ussr has been accused of meddling essentially in affairs in the west such as the aforementioned .. that i talked about the previous section notes 

	american .. elections 

	so this is the cold war that started at the least 1950s although one might say even before that some some and whether or not it's continued directly continued or indirectly it still exists in some form this cold war you can see the cold war had its origins obviously in world war 

	ii former allies .. split into two camps and the countries that they each involved that were involved on this side the countries that were taken over on this side 

	became part of two different alliances now with this cold war it does have a direct effect on the internet so world war ii had a indirect effect on the cold war cold wars we'll see has had a direct effect on the internet the cold war one way that the two sides were competing was the space race now what we're talking about is before humans were able to send artificial satellites into space they were both competing on the ground to be dominant in different ways with standard weapons conventional weapons as they referred to 

	non-nuclear type weapons .. but also 


00:19:39,679
	.. when when nuclear weapons became more common for each .. major power they were competing and still competing in terms of .. their nuclear weaponry but in addition to that they're also trying to be dominant in the space now there's a few reasons why they were trying to be dominant 

	

	partly it was the bragging rights the first country i could send an artificial satellite into space there's a great propaganda effect we you don't believe in the propaganda effect well look at the .. what they call the sputnik i'm talking about the vaccine the split neck i think they called sputnik 2. the russian federation said quote they came up with the first vaccine cure treatment for covid of course the only test on a few dozen people whereas normally you test on tens of thousands one of the reasons why they pushed for that is for the bragging rights we are the first country that came up with it that's what what they say and that's the story to stick to it but obviously no one's .. no other countries have wide skill adopted it because they only tested on a few dozen people for gossip when you should be testing with well the americans need 30 000 people for it to be at minimum to be to be approved by their fda so there's bragging rights of that don't underestimate that there's still some breaking rights talking about terms of 

	technological advances covet bragging and other benefits who's getting the covet vaccine first there's obviously other advantages for that but sending the satellite in the space besides just the propaganda and bragging rights the morale 


00:21:20,320
	the perceived morale advantages if one can 

	actually develop a mechanism for launching a satellite in space to basically break earth's gravity 

	then that is a major strategic advantage because you have technology lance launched something in orbit now potentially it's .. it's possible to be able to launch something say from us ussr longer range missiles so it also has military applications and the direct i think i've definitely mentioned this a little bit 

	the direct analogy is korea north korea was another one of the proxy fights between 

	.. the korean conflict between the 

	warsaw pact and the 

	and nato but modern day north korea they're frequently doing various things depending on who you ask trying to launch missiles or they just say artificial satellites but even if they're truly just researching the ability to launch artificial probes into space if they have that ability to launch artificial probes into space then that improves their ability to launch missiles that can i believe they can reach the hawaiian islands the u.s part of the u.s and possibly alaska but also reach different parts of continental us and that's why it's so .. somewhat of so much concern to the u.s that a state like north korea is either working under quote satellite launching capability or essentially the rocket program and other states in the middle east are of 

	have been of .. of .. interest so we say to countries such as the u.s for different 


00:23:08,000
	reasons but for similar essentially that developing that technology so in the 1950s it appeared that the ussr now this isn't 

	a quote technological ad but a real one they had the technological edge what was 

	happening was in 1957 the americans the americans if you look at their mail you've heard probably many things about their military spending budget .. one metric they use is the number of aircraft carriers the the ships that can carry air .. full fleet carriers that can carry airplanes jets bombers .. dead bombish type type planes .. they have a fleet of 20 of these last i checked 

	.. china just got one a secondhand one that was a cast off from the old ussr .. the ussr i'm not too sure how many .. sorry the russian federation how many they have but they don't have that 20. and canada fleet carriers has zero so they they this is one reason why they spend .. their military budget so much another reason is 

	to use a programming metaphor they if i described how they spent on their weapon tree using a metaphor programming metaphor well they would be writing a program that had all the bells and whistles handled all the cases or almost all the cases that you can imagine had fancy features for robustness and so on their artificial satellite 1950s a sophisticated one bells and whistles three stage rockets so you'd launch off the one stage enough of a a rocket to launch you so the initial part would fall off we didn't need any more because we were .. we were up high enough we had .. earth's gravity was loaded up so we had a second stage and so on that's what pages rockets very simply put 


00:25:01,039
	and they had planned it as the first artificial satellite 

	to be sent into space however the ussr beat them to the punch they essentially their metaphor to extend the metaphor of programming they the u.s planned a very fancy program a very fancy .. they included very fancy technology in the rocket 

	what'd the soviets do ah essentially and they really surprised the whole world basically with their hack they launched sputnik one the the latest footnick i think it's to anyhow the i know it's sputnik something the so-called vaccine for kovid that was supposed to be developed by the and you can hear my and other peoples people who are experts in the field have some skepticism about the the the efficacy of it .. but not the efficacy of the the sputnik one efficacy of the vaccine split neck one basically it was just an adaptation of their military rockets and it was the first artificial satellite and we see the sputnik here in a picture so it's brought into orbit using adaptation of their military technology 

	

	well let's put this in perspective now besides having this cold war at the time nuclear weapons were new in 1945 they were first and the only time that they're used against nation state was against japan 

	and hiroshima and nagasaki new and very scary weapon and there's still a scary weapon although not so new in the 1950s if you look at old history books history documentaries there was very much a fear of 


00:26:54,000
	the possibility of nuclear war nuclear annihilation .. they used to refer to it as mad mutually-ish i believe was mad mutually assured destruction where both sides would wipe each other out if a nuclear war occurred so both sides were quite scared consequently with this 

	background information the u.s 

	did not take this well it wasn't it wasn't similar to the reception when the russian federation said that we have a cure for covet they just they didn't react much most countries didn't react much they tried to analyze what information was available for the 

	the .. vaccine coveted but the satellite culvert basically caused the americans to freak right out because for the reasons i described well there's the the the morale boost there's the propaganda bragging rights but also militarily if the ussr could launch an artificial satellite now they've got believed in advance quite rightfully that they have advanced their missile technology to better attack the us and its allies 

	so in response the u.s created arpa the arpa project which is yet another acronym the advanced research projects agency in the u.s 

	and this agency still exists today .. it's undergone number of name changes you look under arpa i believe that's back to darpa again arpa darpa and then .. you can look it up i've lost track of the number of name changes it still exists and you can actually see the research that they do they're not just involved in research for military research but actually saw .. under the current .. current project name they actually 


00:28:39,440
	are conducting research they have early on in the spring they're conducting research for a cohort vaccine 

	they do some good work .. so but the 

	motivations for our book came from the launch of the sputnik which came from the cold war which came which was indirectly affected by world war ii but we still haven't gotten to the internet yet the internet's coming up we're building to the climax here just to add insult to entry to make the us feel like well no they're actually trying to advance their search legitimately later at night so the early 1950s earlier in 1957 

	the ussr launched sputnik later in 1957 they launched yet another artificial life an artificial satellite that could carry a life form up in it and that's different because sputnik didn't actually have any life forms it didn't have to have a life support system now they developed a second satellite that could have an artificial .. that had a life support system that launched a dog leica which is supposed to be russian forgive me if i'm pronouncing that i'm undoubtedly pronouncing this wrong for russian speaking people as best i can leica .. which referred to barker barker and russian therefore to you poor poor little guy 

	it's a one-way trip to space yeah and that's not a sarcastic sigh i 

	yeah double checking my technology as far as i see i just took a quick look at my recording one that's why there's a bit of a break there to see if it's still appears recording thank gosh okay before this the us had the image basically as being 


00:30:18,000
	the numeral uno and that wasn't just propaganda they were the first ones that actually successfully developed and actually used nuclear weaponry and that's a scary thing good thing or not well good u.s thought it was a good thing in terms of their their defense obviously not so good for the country where it was dropped on them but this really cemented the image of us being dominant and in terms of conventional forces they were extremely powerful if you interested you could actually look at the comparisons of the u.s weapons at the end of world war ii their fighter craft their warships and you compare their theirs versus their tanks versus soviet and typically they come out ahead .. in terms of one-on-one but the total numbers 

	.. so that the the soviet union could do this it really shook .. that image and as i've said if they could lance launch these artificial satellites and space as i said many times then that improves their ability to hit continental u.s so as a solution quote solution it was believed the solution was well let's throw more money in math and science and we saw with the .. was it the von neumann interview if you actually saw the extra little one the it was believed that in grade school that they needed more math and science .. especially high school so that americans coming out of grade school because not so many americans then not so many people in the world actually got a post-secondary education could 


00:32:07,200
	produce better work out think their soviet counterparts and then some of the interesting things i dug up trying to find specific now we've heard out of that if you've watched your news reels or propaganda reels actual newsreels on that era they frequently say do this and they'd say do x action do it for your country buy bonds do it for your country it's patriotic and they still do that sort of thing these days .. for a while the the current american president said i believe he said i know the incoming president said .. wear a mask it's it's it's your your american duty something that effect now fine now this is the first time i've heard someone say apparently this very pitch for your own sake but for patriotism do your homework apparently that was a quote from the harvard university president at the time james bryant so it was believed to be studying was patriotic now whether or not it succeeded getting kids to do their math homework well that that's another thing dwight eisenhower white oops white eisenhower i talked about in terms of we call the american election eisenhower versus .. stevenson he was a famous american general and as you know he became
